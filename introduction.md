### Storativity of Confined Aquifers

**Bar graph** shows values based on selected parameters to the right.

**Tables** list actual values used in calculations for the 5 rock types when selecting minimum (min), maximum (max) or average (avg).

Storativity, S, is volume of water released from storage per unit surface area of the confined aquifer per unit decline in hydraulic head.

Specific storage, Ss, is volume of water that a unit volume of the confined aquifer releases from storage under a unit decline in head.
