# Hydrogeology Demos
Creating demos for the hydrogeology course, EOSC325, using Plotly Dash. This dashboard is hosted [here](https://hydro-storativity.herokuapp.com/).

## Storativity
This demo is based on the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPunca56Vds&list=PLp1lK6n-xb5O8RnVhcfYvqy1kzU_5IfDF&index=7) and its [associated spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WIMPJ2ZS_rEd54-sw0cIqxvwyjLahRv0/view).

The demo is a bar graph comparing the storativity for 5 different materials, with customizable water density, porosity, alpha values (aquifer compressibility), and aquifer thickness.
